               <h3>What is incubator107?</h3>
               <p>incubator107 is the place where anyone can learn and teach anybody anything. The main values of incubator107 are: non formal education, community and passion.</p>
<p>As a project of Macaz Association, incubator107 encourages people from the local community to discover their passions and to follow their calling. Passionate people from the community take courage and decide to share their hobbies, skills and talents. Each month incubator107 launches a new set of 10-12 different workshops with meetings for each day. The new workshops are launched at the beginning of the month with an opening event, where we also throw concerts, performances or demonstrations.</p>
<p>The project is self-sustainable through donations of the participants and the time donated by the volunteers. The donations are split in 3: one part goes to the trainer, one to the project (that covers materials and utility costs for the space) and one part for the organizing team.</p>
<p>The workshops are part of 10 guilds: Crafters Guild (handmade creations, crafting and building workshops), Movers Guild (dance and sports workshops), Vociferators Guild (musical, theatre and communication workshops), Discoverers Guild (personal and professional development workshops), Travelers Guild, Hedonists Guild (workshops related to beauty, massage and games), Culinary Guild, Children Guild, Wizards Guild (spirituality workshops) and Mentors Guild.</p>

<p>incubator107 means discovering the potential in a community and then finding the places and opportunities in which these trainers can grow. incubator107 is present to the biggest festivals in the country, collaborates with institutions, NGOs and companies so that the talent discovered is shared in as many directions as possible.</p>
<p>incubator107 encourages the trainers and the entire community to follow their vocation and to make a living out of it. Each year we organize the Quit Your Job Project, where psychologists, entrepreneurs, coaches and trainers offer tools for discovering your vocation, growing your entrepreneurial spirit and easing the transition from a profession or industry to another.</p>
<p>How can you franchise this project in your country?</p>
<p>To receive the incubator107 franchise you need an enthusiastic and organized team of 4 local coordinators and an NGO to support the initiative. You must find a public or private space where the daily workshops and monthly opening events will take place. If you are interested, tell us right away: noi@incubator107.com.</p>
<p>Currently incubator107 has 7 franchises in Romania: Cluj, Timisoara, Iasi, Brasov, Oradea, Craiova and Sibiu. The long term strategy of incubator107 is to expend beyond the borders, offering this example of a sustainable project in other countries as well. With the help of Youth in Action funding programme, incubator107 has organized an EVS (European Voluntary Service) project through which 2 volunteers (from Italy and Austria) have analyzed and experimented the incubator107 model and the way it's implemented in 5 of the partner cities over a period of 8 months.</p>
